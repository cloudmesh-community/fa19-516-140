## Introduction  

The main objective of this project is to provide AI capabilities on cloud. The developed functionalities will be implemented on two different cloud platforms in order to make a comparison based on performance and resilience. The scope of work for this deployemnt is to build cababilities on the cloud allows recieving feeds in a data form (either structured/unstructured) from end users and the service shouls interpret these feeds an responds back an automated cognitve responce, this reponse could be advices or actions based on the data nature. As the design and requirements are evolving during this project, scope of work shall be expanded as well and this will be reflected and documented here rapidly.
